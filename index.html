        <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
        <p>This is my website for my CSC106 Joy of Programming college course. This is my first website that I have ever created using HTML. This is my first time ever using a programming software as well, and so far I have been enjoying it.
           I want to expand my knowledge on programming language because I believe it will help me in my future career. Even if I do not use<strong>all</strong> of what I learn in my coputer science 
           classes, the ability to understand coding or have a basic knowledge of it, will help anyone down the line. </p>
