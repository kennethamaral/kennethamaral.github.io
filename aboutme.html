        <h1><strong>About Me!</strong></h1> 
         <p>This is my website for my CSC106 Joy of Programming college course. 
            I am a junior, going for a BS in Economics with minors in English and Computer Science.<br> 
            This is my first time ever using a programming software as well, and so far I have been enjoying it. 
            I want to expand my knowledge on<br> programming language because I believe it will help me in my future career.
            I was born and raised in Rhode Island, and went to high school in North Providence.<br>I took one computer class in
            high school, where I mainly learned about the in and outs of excel.<br> I'm hoping to expand my knowledge on coding 
            and computer science itself throughout the rest of my time at college. </p>
